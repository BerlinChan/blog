## My favorite lines

> Why don't I have a choice? I came here on my own free will.

> In nearly every case, the essential results are the same. They heisitate, sigh, tremble and groan, but they advance to the last switch, 450 volts, "Danger Severe Shock XXX", because they're politely told to. The results are terrifying and depressing.

> The agentic state, in which the demands of the democratically installed authority conflict with conscience.
> **The Banality of Evil.**

> In the agentic state, the individual difines himself as an instrument carrying out the wished of others.

> A person has a choice. He or she chooses to become agentic. But once you assume the role, it's almost impossible to go back.

> Every day I choose you.

> ♪ Fools give you reasons. Wise men never try ♪

> You could say we're puppets, with perception, with awareness. Sometimes we can see the strings, and perhaps, our awareness is the first step in our liberation.
