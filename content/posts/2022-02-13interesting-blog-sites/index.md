description: Some interesting blogs or articles that I like, jot them here in case I want to read them again.

When I surf on the Internet, I found some interesting, useful, impression, inspired blogs/sites occassionally, sometimes I want to find it out and read it again, but I had nothing clues to find them, that's really made me feel frustrate.

Next time when I find something like this, I'll jot it down here.


## [Letters To A New Developer](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/)

I heard a principle of programming from my colleague,

> Always leave the code better than you found it.

I found this site when I was search the explaination, and found more interesting letters on the site, like this one: [The Surprising Number Of Programmers Who Can’t Program](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/08/23/the-surprising-number-of-programmers-who-cant-program/). I'm curies what's the **FizzBuzz** about, so I searched it and found an other interesting post, [Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow](https://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/).

Although it's a fiction story, I believe so, but the idea behind it is enlightening, and the author even wrote a [book](https://joelgrus.com/2020/06/06/ten-essays-on-fizz-buzz/) about it.

I found it by one of the author's project named [CFEditor: Make Routers Great Again](https://cfeditor.feng.si/), it's a ASUS router CFE modify tool. In the site, there is a terminal window on every top of the post, and the command-line described the gist of each post, it's very interesting! There is a post explained [why you should keep away from CentOS](https://feng.si/posts/2019/07/centos-the-last-linux-distro-you-should-ever-consider/), the author's point of view is unique.
