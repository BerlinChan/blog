 I just saw the comedy movie "[Don't Look Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/)", it's seriously funny, like [what the director said](https://youtu.be/YEj3juMYCn4?t=42).
 
<!-- endExcerpt -->

It's a perfect sample to help us to understand why would people say "The core of comedy is the tragedy".
 
I like the scene when DiCaprio's character yelling towards the camera, shouted "the president of the United State is f**king lying." His acting was so crazy and emotional.
