 I just saw the comedy movie "[Don't Look Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/)", it's seriously funny, like [what the director said](https://youtu.be/YEj3juMYCn4?t=42). It means serious and funny.

It's a perfect sample to help us to understand why would people say "The core of comedy is the tragedy".
 
I like the scene when DiCaprio's character yelling towards the camera, shouted "the president of the United State is f**king lying." His acting was so crazy and emotional.

## My Favorite Lines

> OK. At this very moment, I say we sit tight and assess.

> The divisions in this country are bad enough. We don't want more of that in our house.

> Sometimes we need to just be able to say things to one another. We need to hear things.

> Just look up, turn off the shitbox news.

> I'm gratefull we tried.

> We really did have everything, didn't we?
