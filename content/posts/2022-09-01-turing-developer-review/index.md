I changed my job to Turing as a front-end developer and work for a US-based company since April, and was invited to record a review video.

For making this video, it takes my whole family 2-day to tidy the messy house‚ú®. It was a wonderful journey to make this video with Turing's team and my familyüëç!

I like the movie "[The Imitation Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/)" that I mentioned in the video.
